# SKEL — Story Keyframe Extensible Layout

**v2.9** | An open storyboard data format

> A flat, relational YAML format for encoding visual narratives into machine-readable, validatable story data.

## What Is SKEL?

SKEL (Story Keyframe Extensible Layout) is an open format that represents screenplays, storyboards, and visual narratives as flat, relational data. The native authoring format is YAML (`.skel`); `.skel.json` is the JSON export/interchange form of the same data model. Instead of deeply nested trees, SKEL stores acts, scenes, and shots as top-level arrays linked by ID references — like a relational database for stories.

SKEL is the native story format of **Genlock Studio**, the desktop storyboard studio, and is designed to be read and written by any tool.

Designed for:
- AI-driven image/video generation pipelines (Flux, Kling, Runway, WAN, etc.)
- Storyboard authoring tools
- Cross-tool interchange between screenplay editors and production software

## Quick Start

Validate a document with the reference CLI:

```bash
npx @skel/cli validate story.skel                # or: node reference/cli/skel.mjs validate story.skel
skel validate story.skel --lifecycle export --json --with-sidecars
skel convert story.skel story.skel.json          # YAML ⇄ JSON
skel inspect story.skel                          # structure, cast, coverage at a glance
```

Get live validation + token autocomplete in VS Code by starting your `.skel` file with the modeline:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandflowr/SKELETON-Brandflowr/v2.9.0/spec/skel.schema.json
skel_version: "2.0"
```

Repo health: `npm install && npm run check` validates every shipped artifact, runs the conformance corpus, the MUSCLE host demo, and the Fountain round-trip — the same suite as CI.

## Conformance

Implementations claim classes — **Reader**, **Writer**, **Validator**, **Full Host** — defined in [`spec/skel-spec.md`](./spec/skel-spec.md) §9, and self-certify against [`tests/conformance/`](./tests/conformance/). Use of the SKEL/BONE/MUSCLE marks is conditioned on conformance ([TRADEMARKS.md](./TRADEMARKS.md)). Spec changes follow [GOVERNANCE.md](./GOVERNANCE.md); security reports follow [SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md).

## Plugin System

SKEL has a two-layer plugin system, following the skeleton metaphor:

- **BONE** (Base Object Narrative Export) — *data* plugins. A `.bone.json` file attaches AI generation config, prompt contracts, and pipeline data to SKEL entities. See [`spec/bone-spec.md`](./spec/bone-spec.md) and the starter definitions in [`spec/bones/`](./spec/bones/).
- **MUSCLE** (Modular User-Scripted Companion Logic Extension) — *behavior* plugins. A `.muscle.json` manifest subscribes to named lifecycle hooks (import, validation, prompt assembly, generation, render write-back, export) and returns JSON patches that the host validates and applies atomically. MUSCLEs never touch documents directly. See [`spec/muscle-spec.md`](./spec/muscle-spec.md).

`.skel` is the body layout, `.bone` files are what attaches to it, `.muscle` files are what makes it move.

Want to build a plugin? Start with [`spec/MUSCLE_AUTHORING.md`](./spec/MUSCLE_AUTHORING.md), copy an example from [`spec/muscles/`](./spec/muscles/), and test against the [reference host](./reference/muscle-host/):

```bash
cd reference/muscle-host/demo && node run-demo.mjs
```
