# Writing a MUSCLE

How to build a behavior plugin for SKEL. Normative details live in [muscle-spec.md](./muscle-spec.md); this is the practical path.

A MUSCLE is two things:

1. **A manifest** (`your-plugin.muscle.json`) — declares what hooks you listen to, what you're allowed to touch, and how a host runs you.
2. **A tool** (any language) — receives a JSON envelope, returns a JSON result. That's the whole integration surface.

---

## 1. Pick your hook and mode

| You want to... | Hook | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| Add custom validation / lint rules | `document.validate` | `veto` |
| Rewrite or style-enforce assembled prompts | `prompt.assemble.after` | `transform` |
| Adjust BONE data before prompt assembly | `prompt.assemble.before` | `transform` |
| Import/export another format losslessly | `import.after` / `export.before` | `transform` |
| Post-process finished renders | `render.complete` | `transform` |
| Sync edits to an external system | `entity.changed` | `observe` |
| Route generation (queueing, cost gating) | `generate.route` | `transform` |

Modes: `observe` = read-only, `transform` = may return patches or a `subject_replacement`, `veto` = may return validation errors. The host rejects anything beyond your declared mode.

## 2. Write the manifest

```json
{
  "$schema": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brandflowr/SKELETON-Brandflowr/v2.9.0/spec/muscle.schema.json",
  "muscle_id": "my-shot-lint",
  "muscle_version": "1.0.0",
  "label": "My Shot Lint",
  "description": "Warns when shots break my studio's rules.",
  "hooks": [
    { "on": "document.validate", "mode": "veto", "priority": 100, "timeout_ms": 10000 }
  ],
  "capabilities": ["read:document"],
  "execution_routes": [
    { "type": "cli", "label": "My Shot Lint", "command": "node my-shot-lint.mjs" }
  ]
}
```

Rules of thumb:

- Prefix `muscle_id` with your studio/handle to avoid collisions (`acme-shot-lint`).
- Declare the **minimum** capabilities you need — hosts show them to users as a consent screen, and every patch outside them rejects your whole patch set.
- If you write vendor data, use your own extension namespace: `patch:extensions.x-acme` lets you write `extensions.x-acme` on any entity and nothing else. The host creates the `extensions` container for you if it's missing.
- Validate your manifest against [`muscle.schema.json`](./muscle.schema.json) before shipping.

## 3. Write the tool

For the `cli` route: read the envelope from stdin, write the result to stdout, exit 0. Complete working example (Node, but any language works):

```js
const envelope = JSON.parse(await new Response(process.stdin).text());
const doc = envelope.document ?? {};

const errors = [];
for (const [i, shot] of (doc.shots ?? []).entries()) {
  if (!shot.action?.trim()) {
    errors.push({
      code: "my-shot-lint.empty-action",   // always prefix codes with your muscle_id
      severity: "error",
      path: `/shots/${i}/action`,
      message: `Shot ${shot.id} has no action text.`,
    });
  }
}

process.stdout.write(JSON.stringify({ payload_version: "1.0", ok: true, errors }));
```

The envelope and result shapes are formally defined in [`hook-payload.schema.json`](./hook-payload.schema.json). Key envelope fields: `hook`, `lifecycle` (`draft`/`production`/`export`), `context.config` (your per-project settings), `document` (only if you hold `read:document`), and a hook-specific `subject`.

## 4. Mutating the document: patches

Transform MUSCLEs never return a modified document — they return [RFC 6902 JSON Patch](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc6902) operations:

```json
{
  "payload_version": "1.0",
  "ok": true,
  "patches": [
    { "op": "add", "path": "/shots/0/extensions/x-acme", "value": { "reviewed": true } }
  ]
}
```

The host checks every path against your capabilities, refuses writes to `creative_status: locked` entities and to `metadata.plugins`, applies your set atomically, re-validates the document, and rolls back if anything breaks. Worst case for a buggy plugin: a rejected, logged patch set. You cannot corrupt a project.

For derived-value hooks, return `subject_replacement` instead — e.g. the rewritten prompt string on `prompt.assemble.after`. It affects only the in-flight value, never the saved document.

## 5. Test against the reference host

```bash
cd reference/muscle-host/demo
node run-demo.mjs
```

Drop your manifest in a `muscles/` folder, point `discoverMuscles()` at it, and invoke your hook with a real document (the spec ships [`example.skel.json`](./example.skel.json)). The reference host enforces the same rules Genlock does — if your plugin behaves there, it's conformant. See [reference/muscle-host/](../reference/muscle-host/) for three worked examples (a linter, a patcher, and a deliberately misbehaving plugin).

## 6. Ship it

- Distribute the manifest + your tool however you like; users drop the manifest into `{workspace}/muscles/` or `{project}/muscles/`.
- Version with semver. Breaking manifest changes bump MAJOR.
- Remember discovery ≠ enabled: users opt in per project, and hosts surface your declared capabilities when they do.
