# SKEL - Story Keyframe Extensible Layout

> A flat, relational YAML format for encoding visual narratives into machine-readable, validatable story data.

---

## What Is SKEL?

SKEL is Genlock's native story format. A project stores its authoring document as `story.skel`, a UTF-8 YAML file. Instead of deeply nested trees, SKEL stores Acts, Scenes, and Shots as top-level arrays linked by ID references - like a relational database for stories. `.skel.json` is the explicit export/interchange form of the same data model.

It was designed for:
- AI-driven image/video generation pipelines (Runway, Kling, Sora, etc.)
- Storyboard authoring tools (Genlock)
- Cross-tool interchange between screenplay editors and production software

## Why It Matters

| Problem | SKEL Solution |
|---|---|
| Screenplay formats (Fountain, FDX) have no visual metadata | SKEL encodes camera, lighting, lens, and movement per shot |
| Nested story trees are fragile and hard to query | Flat relational structure — query any shot by ID |
| No standard for AI prompt pipelines | `action` + `prompt` + `v_setup` fields map directly to generation APIs |
| Formats break when tools add custom data | `extensions` object with `x-` namespacing keeps the core spec clean |
| No validation for story structure | JSON Schema + referential integrity checks catch errors before they hit production |

---

## Terminology: SKEL vs Genlock

SKEL uses the term **Acts** for the top-level story grouping. Genlock Studio surfaces this as **Chapters** in its UI. These are the same entity — `act_id` in SKEL maps to the chapter container in Genlock. When the spec says "act", Genlock shows "chapter".

### Implementation

Reference implementations in this repo: [`reference/cli/`](../reference/cli/) (validator/converter/inspector, published as `@skel/cli`), [`reference/muscle-host/`](../reference/muscle-host/), [`reference/fountain-adapter/`](../reference/fountain-adapter/), [`reference/continuity-guard/`](../reference/continuity-guard/), plus TypeScript types in [`types/skel.d.ts`](../types/skel.d.ts) (published as `@skel/spec`).

The Genlock Studio host implementation lives in the app repo (`app/utils/skel/`):

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `types.ts` | TypeScript interfaces matching the JSON Schema. `SKELDocument`, `SKELScene`, `SKELShot`, `SKELVSetup`, etc. |
| `validator.ts` | Schema validation (AJV) + referential integrity checks + duplicate ID detection. |
| `keyfile.ts` | `SKELKeyResolver` class. Expands shorthand tokens to full definitions with spec-compliant fallback defaults. |
| `converter.ts` | Bidirectional conversion: `masterStoryToSKEL()`, `storyToSKEL()`, `SKELToStory()`. |
| `bone.ts` | `BoneResolver` class. Loads definitions, resolves inheritance chain, validates BONE data. |

### Genlock-Specific Extension Data (stored in `x-genlock` namespace)

These files live in each Genlock project folder and carry data that extends SKEL but is not part of the core spec. They are stored alongside `story.skel` (the native SKEL document). `story.json` is legacy/migration input only.

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `audio-map.json` | Versioned `tracks` envelope mapping shot IDs to typed dialogue, SFX, and music arrays. |
| `video-map.json` | Versioned `takes` envelope mapping shot IDs to numbered video takes with at most one active take. |

Additional Genlock extension contracts:

| Extension | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `extensions.x-genlock.proposals` | Optional proposal history on SKEL entities. Stores pending/accepted/rejected AI or user suggestions without changing core SKEL fields. |
| `x-genlock.schema.json` | Supplementary schema for Genlock-owned extension data, including proposal objects. The core SKEL schema remains vendor-neutral. |

### Dependencies

| Package | Version | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `ajv` | `^8.18.0` | JSON Schema validation engine |

---

## Quick Start

### Validate a SKEL document
```ts
import { validateSKEL } from '~/utils/SKEL/validator'

const result = validateSKEL(myDocument)
if (!result.valid) {
  console.error(result.errors)
}
```

### Resolve BONE data for a shot (with inheritance)
```ts
import { BoneResolver } from '~/utils/SKEL/bone'

const resolver = new BoneResolver(SKELDoc.bone_registry)
const result = resolver.resolveForShot('flux-dev', SKELDoc, shot)
// result.data → { text: "...", negative: "blurry...", guidance: 9, seed: 42 }
// result.source → ['defaults', 'metadata', 'act', 'scene', 'shot']
```

### Resolve tokens from a shot
```ts
import { SKELKeyResolver } from '~/utils/SKEL/keyfile'

const resolver = new SKELKeyResolver()
const resolved = resolver.resolveSetup(shot.v_setup)
// resolved.size → { token: "cu", label: "Close-Up", description: "Subject's face fills the frame." }
```

### Export a Genlock project to SKEL JSON
```ts
import { masterStoryToSKEL } from '~/utils/SKEL/converter'

const SKELDoc = masterStoryToSKEL(masterStory)
```

### Import a SKEL file into Genlock
```ts
import { SKELToStory } from '~/utils/SKEL/converter'

const story = SKELToStory(SKELDoc, projectId)
```

### Parse a Fountain screenplay to SKEL
```ts
import { fountainToSkel } from '~/utils/fountainToSkel'

const SKELDoc = fountainToSkel(fountainSource)
// Produces: acts[], scenes[], shots[] with action, dialogue, and character_refs
```

## Core Concepts

### Flat Relational Structure
```
┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐     ┌──────────┐
│   Acts   │────▶│  Scenes  │────▶│  Shots   │
│(Chapters)│     │          │     │          │
│ scene_   │     │ act_id   │     │ scene_id │
│ refs[]   │     │ shot_    │     │ v_setup  │
│          │     │ refs[]   │     │ action   │
└──────────┘     └──────────┘     └──────────┘
     IDs link everything. No nesting.
     Genlock shows Acts as "Chapters" in the UI.
```

### Token System
Shots use shorthand tokens (`cu`, `noir`, `dolly`) that the Key File expands to full definitions. This keeps `.skel` files small while preserving rich metadata for rendering engines.

### Extensions
Any entity can carry vendor-specific data via `extensions` with `x-` namespaced keys:
```json
{ "extensions": { "x-genlock": { "production_status": "approved", "startFrameImage": "..." } } }
```

Genlock proposal history lives under `extensions.x-genlock.proposals`. Proposal objects have stable IDs, a `type`, a `status` (`pending`, `accepted`, `rejected`, or `superseded`), and a short `summary`. See `SKEL/spec/x-genlock.schema.json` for the supplementary schema.

### Production Status (split image / video)
Shots carry a `status` object with separate image and video production states. Both take:
`not_started` | `pending` | `generating` | `review` | `approved` | `rejected` | `failed`

The core `status` field is the canonical home of production status (since 2.9); `extensions.x-genlock.production_status` is a deprecated mirror (see MIGRATIONS.md §4).

### Audio Map (Genlock extension)
`audio-map.json` stores a `version: "1.0"` envelope whose `tracks` object maps each shot ID to typed `dialogue`, `sfx`, and `music` track arrays. It is persisted outside the SKEL document to keep media references decoupled from story structure.

### Video Takes (Genlock extension)
`video-map.json` stores a `version: "1.0"` envelope whose `takes` object maps each shot ID to numbered video takes. At most one take is active; the timeline dynamically creates track lanes for each take level used in the project.
